===========

This repository is a part of tutorial on how to use github. It might also have some practical use lather though.

In the future I will create another repository dedicated to the Matlab program I'm developping with another person. This software is to be used for the data analysis of single molecule Förster Resonant Energy Transfer (FRET) data
